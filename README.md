This dataset contains _Jeopardy!_ clues from Season 1 through Season 41 (July 2025). It does not contain every clue that has appeared on the show. The data source prefers not to be credited.

There are 538,845 clues in total. Most of them can be found in `combined_season1-41.tsv`. There are individual files for each season, located in the `seasons` folder.

Clues appearing in special matches outside the daily syndicated program are found in `extra_matches.tsv`. This file has 8,906 clues and they do not appear in the combined dataset.

There is a `kids_teen_matches.tsv` file which contains only clues that were featured in Kids and Teen Tournament matches. These clues are also in the combined dataset but this file is included for convenience.

I've done my best to clean the data and filter out clues that depend on images, video, or audio.
